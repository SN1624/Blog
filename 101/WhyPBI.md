## Opening Statement

Prior to selecting a BI tool (PowerBI, Tableau, ...), you should think about your desired outcomes - you don't buy a hamer without a nail.  So what positive outcomes can come from a BI tool?  

Microsoft gives us a number of points within their [what is Power BI page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/what-is-power-bi/):
* Connect to hundreds of data sources
* Visualize your data 
* Securely share insights across your organization
* Securely embed reports in apps/websites

Tableau also has their [what is Tableau page](https://www.tableau.com/products/what-is-tableau) with a number of similar points:
* From connection to collaboration
* Turn data into insights that drive actions
* Secure end-to-end analytics
