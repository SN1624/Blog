# MS Power BI Dataflows

## Problem Statement
When adding a visualization to a report for a field that has lots of items, it can be useful to limit the visualization down to show only the top 5 or top 10 items.  We can do this by using MS Power BI's built in TopN visual level filter as shown here:

Sometimes though, especially when dealing with a field that has a few items with high values, and a lot of items with low values, it can be useful to show the top 5 or top 10 and then aggregate all other items into an "other" category.  While this is not currently (Nov 2018) possible using the built-in TopN functionality, it is asked for quite often, including in the comments of the orginal TopN request on [ideas.powerbi.com](https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi-ideas/suggestions/6515731-top-n-filters).  

All that being said, just because this functionality isn't built into MS Power BI, that doesn't mean it's not possible.  With a bit of [DAX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/data-analysis-expressions-dax-reference), we are able to build our own "TopN and Other" functionality into any report.  Follow along with the rest of this article to find out how.

## Solution Walkthrough
To build this solution, we've loaded the example data [US services trade data](exampledata/US-Services-TradeData.csv) into MS Power BI.  No further changes to this data have been made.


### Finished Product
We now have all the measures and the visualization in place, and we are showing the Top N and Other in a bar chart.  To see this in MS Power BI Desktop, I've included the .pbix file [here](https://github.com/ssugar/Blog/raw/master/TopNAndOther/pbix/TopNAndOther.pbix)
