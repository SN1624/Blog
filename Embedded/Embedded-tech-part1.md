###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

This is the first of a 3-part series on PowerBI Embedded.  This series is meant for a technical audience.  An executive-focused article on PowerBI Embedded can be found [here](./Embedded-exec.md).

For this series, we'll be focused on the PowerBI Embedded A-Series (Azure) SKU, and we'll be using the "App Owns Data" model, which is the model that allows you to embed Power BI reports for your customers.  More information on this model can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedding#embedding-for-your-customers).

### Requirements

* An Azure Active Directory tenant (if you'd like to set up a full production environment), or a regular Power BI Pro account (can be used to set up a test environment)
* Visual Studio - Free Community version is available [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
