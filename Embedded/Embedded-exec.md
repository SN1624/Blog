### What is MS Power BI Embedded
MS Power BI Embedded is a service that allows you to embed Power BI reports within your own application, or within SharePoint or Microsoft Teams.  This allows you to connect to hundreds of data sources within Power BI, create beautiful and interactive visuals, dashboards, and reports and then embed those into other applications/websites with minimal code and development.

### Use Cases
* Share reports with customers who don't have PowerBI Pro licenses.
* Embed a Power BI report in an application or website. 

### Options
There are 3 main series of SKUs available that allow embedding of reports:
* PowerBI Premium P SKU
* PowerBI Premium EM SKU
* PowerBI Azure A SKU

### Option Differences
The main difference between the Premium P and the EM SKUs is that the EM SKU doesn't allow you to have users without a Power BI Pro license access content within the PowerBI.com service and via the PowerBI mobile application.  The Azure A SKU is further limited to just allow users without a Power BI Pro license to access content within an independent application (not within Microsoft service like SharePoint/Microsoft Teams), but being an Azure service, it does allow for hourly billing, and pausing/rapid scaling up and down of the service.  With the premium SKUs, a monthly/yearly commitment is required.  A full list of technical/purchasing differences can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded-faq#technical)
