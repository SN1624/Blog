# Excel and MS Power BI
###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

We're doing our reporting in Excel.  We'd like to move it to Power BI

### Some benefits of using MS Power BI 
* 


### Deciding if Power BI is Right For You
Here are a few questions to help you decide if MS Power BI Dataflows is the right move for your organization:
* Do you have multiple reports retrieving the same data (i.e. sales report, quality of service report independently retrieving your client list)
* Do you want to present a unified and consistent 'single source of truth' to enable self-serve reporting?
* Do you want to have multiple team members collaborate on the retrieval and preparation of data.

### Get Started with MS Power BI as soon as possible
If your answers to the questions in the decision points above lead you to believe that Power BI Dataflows is right for your organization, if you just want to learn more about Power BI Dataflows, or if you'd like to be informed when Power BI Dataflows goes from Public Preview to General Availability.
