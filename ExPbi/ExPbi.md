# Excel and MS Power BI - Two Great Tools
###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

When comparing different tools, it's often useful to try and understand the intended purpose of each tool.  Microsoft Excel - created in 1987, was created as a traditional spreadsheet application.  Given it's long life, it has a vast array of features and most business users feel very comfortable using it.  As a traditional spreadsheet, it allows users to reference specific cells (or groups of cells), and do a variety of calculations (simple and complex).  That being said, without complex lookups, add-ons, or manual copy/paste it is difficult to build relationships with other tables/data sources, so we're essentially dealing with a series of unrelated tables.  Power BI is relatively new (July 2015), and is focused on data ingestion, easily building relationships between data sets, alerting, and publishing/sharing reports and dashboards.

### Common Scenario

You've been tasked with creating a new sales report.  You open up your CRM, export your closed deals to CSV, and open it up in Excel.  A bit of cleanup, a few formulas, format as table, a quick chart, save as an excel workbook, and things are looking good.  You can see a customer id number, the deal name, the date the deal closed, projected and actual revenue, and time and material costs.  You send it to your boss - they love it, "great work! now can we see a sales total by customer name?  I only see a customer id number".  

So, back to the CRM, now export all the CRM customers to CSV, open the CSV in Excel, and copy/paste customer id number and customer name columns into the first excel workbook that has the closed deals data.  Now create a lookup formula, or do some manual copy/paste to replace the customer id number in the deals data with the customer name from the customer data, quick pivot table, and now you have actual sales by customer name.  You open up an email to send the report back to your boss, but you have a few moments of hesitation...  you start thinking, what's going to happen next month when your boss wants this report again?  Will I forever be spending time every month exporting data to CSV, slightly modifying formulas, formatting tables, and sending emails with Excel attachments?  What if they want to see this data every week?  What if someone asks for the sales data to be connected to our timesheet data? - that's a totally different system - does it even export to CSV?

### Decision Points

* Do you want to be able to share reports with a broad range of users?
* Do you want to ingest large amounts of data?
* Do you want to create a report based on multiple tables/data sources?
* Do you want to be able to cross filter between visualizations?
* Do you, or are you worried you will spend too much time on manual data ingestion/consolidation processes?

If you answer "yes" to any of the above questions, then you should look at building your report process within Power BI

* Do you want to rapidly explore a single/summarized data table?
* Do you want deep customization of tabular style reports?

If you answer "yes" to any of the above questions, then you should look at using Excel
