# Excel and MS Power BI - 
###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

When comparing different tools, it's often useful to try and understand the intended purpose of the tools.  Microsoft Excel - created in 1987, it is a traditional spreadsheet application.  Given it's long-life, it has a vast array of features and most business users feel comfortable using it.  As a traditional spreadsheet, it allows users to reference specific cells (or groups of cells), and do a variety of calculations (simple and complex).  Without complex lookups or add-ons, it is difficult to build relationships with other tables/data sources, we're essentially dealing with a series of unrelated tables.  Power BI is relatively new (July 2015), and is focused on data ingestion, easily building relationships between data sets, alerting, and publishing/sharing reports and dashboards.
