# Power BI Usage Report
###### by [Scott Sugar](https://linkedin.com/in/scottsugar)

## Problem Statement
"You can't manage what you can't measure".  So when it comes to managing your tenant's online Power BI service, how do you measure the usage of your reports, dashboards, and datasets?  Which reports are getting the most attention?  By who?  Are there unused reports or workgroups that could be cleaned up?

The online PowerBI service does offer "Usage metrics" in the Admin portal, but it's not customizable or interactive, and seems to be more focused on "who has how many reports/dashboard" rather than the question I set out to answer "who's using the service, and what are they looking at?"

### Get-PowerBIUsage Script

The PowerShell script we'll use to grab the activity logs from the O365 Management API and load the results into a Power BI Streaming Dataset can be found [here](Scripts/Get-PowerBIUsage.ps1)

#### Update Script

Before trying to run the script, please update the variables at the top of the script with the values we copied into notepad

![UpdateScript](images/UpdateCode.png)

#### Run Script

To start, you'll need to "create a subscription" so the Management API will start to save your tenant's activities for later retrieval.

```` 
.\Get-PowerBIUsage.ps1 -startSubscription
````

#### Loop Script

The code below will continue to look for available activity logs every 15 minutes and push them into to the streaming dataset.

````
while($true){
  $x = .\Get-PowerBIUsage.ps1
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 900
}
````
